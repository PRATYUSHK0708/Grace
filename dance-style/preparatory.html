            <h2>Preparatory Division</h2>
            <p>
                Grace’s Preparatory Division comprises two Saturday dance programs for students ages 8 to 18:
                Pre-College and the dance Advancement Program (DAP). Juilliard has an ongoing commitment to the
                principles and practices of inclusiveness and strongly encourages applications from students of diverse
                backgrounds. Financial aid, up to and including full-tuition scholarships, is available for both
                programs.</p>

                    Pre-College offers a comprehensive conservatory-style music program for advanced students of
                    elementary through high-school age who exhibit the talent, potential, and ambition to pursue serious
                    music study at the college level. This program is held on Saturdays from September through May on
                    the Juilliard campus, where Pre-College students work with world-class faculty to develop technical
                    proficiency while fostering creativity and intellectual curiosity. Members of Pre-College faculty
                    are distinguished artist-teachers, many of whom are on the Juilliard college faculty. Full- and
                    partial-tuition scholarships are available for eligible admitted students.

                    DAP is a Saturday program for intermediate and advanced music students from New York City’s five
                    boroughs and the tristate area who demonstrate a commitment to artistic excellence. The program
                    actively seeks students from diverse backgrounds underrepresented in the classical music field.
                    Through a rigorous curriculum, performance opportunities, and guidance from an accomplished faculty,
                    MAP students gain the necessary skills to pursue advanced music studies while developing their
                    talents as artists, leaders, and global citizens. Approximately 85 students are enrolled in MAP,
                    which is led by Artistic Director Anthony McGill. All admitted MAP students receive full-tuition
                    scholarships

                    The Preparatory Division’s commissioning of new classical music compositions both enriches the
                    classical music repertoire and forges a path toward a more inclusive and pedagogically valuable
                    repertoire for young musicians. We have commissioned and premiered more than 50 new works in recent
                    years, and the work will continue with approximately 10 new commissions annually moving forward.
